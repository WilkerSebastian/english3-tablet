                IFMS is an institution very connected to technology and has experience with teaching through digital
                teaching platforms, but does not provide a way for its students to have these teaching platforms outside
                the institution other than through their own devices. However, now IFMS makes teaching tablets available
                to all students enrolled in technical courses integrated with the necessary tools to improve teaching

                <p class="text">

                    It is undeniable that the current generation of students was born connected and the use of tablets
                    in
                    education comes from birth. The use of technology in the classroom becomes, therefore, a necessity
                    for
                    schools that do not want to be left behind.

                    We are not talking about meeting a temporary demand, but about adopting an innovation that is here
                    to
                    stay
                    and that can greatly improve the dynamics of teaching and learning, after all the use of the tablet
                    in
                    school education is no longer a trend but a reality.

                    If, at first, computers were the first facilitators, now it is the turn of tablets in schools.
                    Purchased
                    in
                    large numbers by the Ministry of Education (MEC) for use in public schools and a confirmed trend in
                    the
                    private school system, these devices offer numerous advantages.

                    the use of tablets on mobile phones is through which it is possible to use technical students access
                    to teaching use a useful and useful computer for students of the technical course. Built-in tools of

                <h2 class="text-title">Advantages of teaching with tablets</h2>
                <p class="text">

                    The multifunctionality of tablets provides and encourages different ways of learning to use
                    technology in teaching. Due to their ability to translate curriculum content into different formats,
                    they are tools capable of helping teachers to deal with the diversity that exists among students.
                    <br>
                    Imagine the same content available in audio, videos and even for reading. This is exactly what the
                    use of the tablet in school education provides learning in a didactic and pedagogical way. It helps
                    the teacher to face and deal with the particularities of content assimilation of each student.
                    Technology in the classroom is an opportunity to closely monitor each student, from kindergarten to
                    high school.
                    <br><br>
                    Another benefit is that, compared to the amount spent on the purchase of traditional school
                    supplies, the acquisition of these devices for use in the classroom and an internet package can be
                    much more advantageous.

                    In addition, the use of the tablet in school education can also be a differential in terms of
                    mobility and even in the health of students, as it reduces or even eliminates the problem of weight
                    in backpacks.
